    Call the Anthropic API to generate a biological interpretation

        summary_stats: Dict with total, upregulated, downregulated counts
        top_up_genes: List of top upregulated gene names

    prompt = f"""You are an expert computational biologist. Analyse these gene expression results and write a concise, scientifically accurate biological interpretation.

DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION SUMMARY:
- Total genes analysed: {summary_stats['total_genes']}
- Upregulated genes: {summary_stats['upregulated']}
- Downregulated genes: {summary_stats['downregulated']}

TOP UPREGULATED GENES: {', '.join(top_up_genes[:10])}
TOP DOWNREGULATED GENES: {', '.join(top_down_genes[:10])}

MACHINE LEARNING:
- Random Forest classifier AUC: {ml_auc:.3f}
- Top discriminating genes: {', '.join(top_features[:8])}

Write a biological interpretation covering:
1. What biological processes or pathways might these DE genes be involved in?
2. What do the upregulated and downregulated genes suggest about the cellular response?
3. What is the significance of the ML AUC score?
4. What follow-up experiments or analyses would you recommend?
5. Mention 2-3 relevant published databases or tools (e.g. GSEA, STRING, KEGG) researchers should use for pathway enrichment.

Keep the tone professional and scientific. Write in clear paragraphs, not bullet points. Limit to 350 words."""
